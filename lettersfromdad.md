LETTER 01

LETTERS FROM DAD

<br>

Hi kids, 

Here it is. The first letter of a series of letters that I plan to write to you.

Why am I doing this: 

Over the years I couldn’t help but recognize all sorts of things that I would have loved to know growing up, but weren’t taught in school. 
At some point I started to take notes every time I understood something that I found interesting or helpful. Initially I never really considered to do anything with them.


But when you showed up everything changed. 


 As you are still young and it’s uncertain if I can share these lessons in person when the time has come, I’ve decided to write them down.
 
 Frankly, I don’t think that you will follow or apply most of the advice and that is ok.  Life is about making your own mistakes and learning from them. But if even only 5% of this is going to be useful to you, it is still a win. :)

I will try and keep the letters rather short so that you can read them quickly. My goal is to try to get to behind the why of things and give actionable advice, while not being boring. 

You might think: Good luck with that - but hey, it’s worth a try.
 I’ll write them in a somewhat organized manner, but it still should work to jump back and forth as they won’t build too much onto each other. 

A good age to start reading these might be when you enter puberty, so the age when you prefer reading from me rather than talking to me anyways (lol). 

Alright, let’s get started before I risk losing your attention due to even more dad jokes. 
Off to letter number 02.

Love you, 
Dad

LETTER 02

WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT 
(NO, REALLY!) 

<br>

Hi kids,  

Today I am going to write about "What Do You Really Want? (No, Really!)".   Reading the title you might think: That's easy, I want ice cream! 
But trust me, sometimes it's easy and sometimes it is trickier to find out what you really want. No, really! ;)

Let me explain:  

<br>

THE WORLD AND YOU

Here's the thing: we're all influenced by the world around us. Your friends, family, social media, even those sneaky ads – they're all telling you what you should want. Sometimes that makes us try to be all things to all people. But are those things really what you want? 

Let's play a little game: Think about something you really want right now. Got it? Okay, now ask yourself: "Why do I want this?" Keep asking "Why?" until you can't go any further. You might be surprised where you end up!  

<br>

PEELING BACK THE LAYERS

Sometimes, what we think we want is just the wrapping paper. We need to tear it off to find the real gift inside. 
For example: You might say, "I want to be rich!" But why? "So I can buy whatever I want." Okay, but why? "So I need not to worry about money." Ah, now we're getting somewhere! 

See what happened? You started with "being rich" but ended up at "not needing to worry". Those are the real desires hiding underneath. All it took is asking "why" a couple of times.  

<br>

BEING TRUE TO YOU

Now comes the tricky part: being honest with yourself about what you really want. It's not always easy, especially if it's different from what others expect. Even I still find this hard sometimes! 

Imagine this: Your friends are all super excited about joining the hockey team. They keep talking about how awesome it'll be if you all play together. But deep down, you'd rather join the chess club instead. 

It takes guts to say, "Actually, I think I want to try something different." But that's what being true to yourself is all about. It's about listening to that little voice inside you, even when it's saying something unexpected.   To stand out due to wanting something different can be hard sometimes. But remember to be "outstanding" can be something good as well!

Generally, there's no "right" or "wrong" when it comes to what you want. The only mistake is pretending to want something just because you think that's what you're supposed to want.  

<br>

HOW TO FIGURE IT OUT 

So, how do you uncover your true desires? Here are some tricks:

1. Write things down. It will help you to think clearly.

2. Pay attention to what excites you. What makes you lose track of time?

3. Notice your daydreams. What do you imagine when your mind wanders?

4. Think about your dreams when you were little. Sometimes our younger selves knew what we really wanted before the world told us otherwise.

5. Explore your curiosity! Follow your interests, even if they seem unusual. You might uncover passions you never knew existed.
   
<br>

BUT WAIT, IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE?

Now, you might be thinking, "Dad, isn't it selfish to focus so much on what I want?" 
That's a great question! It's true that we shouldn't only think about ourselves. But understanding what you truly want can actually help you contribute more to others. When you know yourself better, you can make choices that make you happy AND help those around you. It's not about being selfish—it's about being your best self!

<br>

WHY IT MATTERS 

Knowing what you truly want is like having a compass for your life. It helps you make decisions that align with your authentic self. And when you're living authentically? That's when life gets really good.

But here's the plot twist: What you want can change over time, and that's okay! The important thing is to keep checking in with yourself. 

Only be beware of shiny new things, they can distract you away from what you really want. When you think about switching course maybe a bit too quickly, it's important to slow down.  Take some time to write and think. 
What do YOU want? Not what you think you should want, or what others want for you, but what lights YOU up inside? Have confidence in your gut feeling. 

It might take some soul-searching, but I promise it's worth it. After all, it's your life – shouldn't you be the one deciding what you want from it? 

Love, Dad 

<br>

P.S. If you figure out what you really want is a pet dragon, let me know. We might need to have another talk about reality vs. fantasy! ;)

LETTER 03

THE HEDONIC TREADMILL: THE NEVER-ENDING CHASE FOR MORE

<br>

Hi kids, 

Today we're going to talk about something called the "hedonic treadmill." I know, it sounds like some fancy exercise equipment, but trust me, it's way more interesting (and way less sweaty)! ;)

<br>

WHAT'S THIS TREADMILL ALL ABOUT?

Imagine you just got the new shoes you've been begging for. You're over the moon excited, right? But after a few weeks, it doesn't feel as thrilling anymore. That's the hedonic treadmill in action: when something good happens, we get a boost of happiness, but over time, we get used to it, and that happiness fades back to our normal level. Even worse, getting the same thing again won't bring as much joy as the first time.

<br>

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?

Here's the deal: understanding the hedonic treadmill can save you a lot of disappointment (and maybe some allowance money too). It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking, "If I just get X, then I'll be happy forever!" But life doesn't work that way.

Instead, we often find ourselves wanting more, better, bigger. The new Lego figure? Cool for a while, but then you start eyeing the ice cream truck. After that it has to be a whole farm. Bigger, better, more!   

This constant chase can leave you feeling unsatisfied and maybe even a bit unhappy. If you're always focused on the next big thing, you might miss out on enjoying what you have right now.

<br>

BREAKING FREE FROM THE TREADMILL

Here are some tricks to outsmart that tricky treadmill: 

1. Appreciate what you have: Take a moment each day to think about something you're grateful for. It could be as simple as your favorite snack or a fun day with friends.

2. Focus on experiences, not things: Material stuff gets old fast, but memories last. That family camping trip might bring you more lasting joy than a new gadget.

3. Set goals: Working towards something gives you a sense of purpose and achievement. Remember, it's not just about reaching the goal, but enjoying the process of getting there.

4. Help others: Doing something kind for someone else can give you a happiness boost that lasts longer than buying something for yourself.

<br>

THE PLOT TWIST

Here's the funny thing about the hedonic treadmill: it works both ways. Just like we get used to good things, we also adapt to not-so-great situations. Remember that time you thought you'd never get over losing your favorite toy? But you did, right?

This is actually pretty cool because it means that even when life throws you a curveball, you have an amazing ability to bounce back. Your baseline happiness is more resilient than you might think!

<br>

BUT WAIT, IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE?

Now, you might be thinking, "Dad, if we always return to our normal happiness level, what's the point of trying to be happier?" That's a great question! 

The hedonic treadmill doesn't mean we can't increase our overall happiness - it just means we need to be smarter about how we do it. Instead of always chasing the next big thing, we can focus on finding joy in everyday moments and building positive habits. 

Let me give you an example. Remember when you first got your bike? You were so excited! But after a while, riding it just became normal. Now, imagine if instead of always wanting a newer, fancier bike, you started to notice how fun it is to feel the wind in your hair, or how cool it is that your legs can power you anywhere you want to go. That's what beating the hedonic treadmill looks like!

<br>

WHY IT MATTERS

Understanding the hedonic treadmill isn't about giving up on wanting things or having goals. It's about being smarter about what really makes you happy in the long run. 

So next time you're tempted to think, "I'll be happy when...", remember to enjoy where you are right now. True happiness comes from appreciating each step of your journey, not just racing to the finish line.

Love, Dad

<br>

PS: Ok, ok… I'll confess, the rule of the Hedonic Treadmill doesn't apply to all things. There is one thing that for me still feels as good as the first time and that is: a hug from you. True story! ;)

LETTER 04

HAPPINESS

<br>

Hi kids, 

Today it's about a big topic: Happiness.

You might think "How is this big? Happiness is super simple: I get what I want, and voila! I'm happy, right? 

Well, kind of. There's more to it than just getting what you want. Happiness also involves what you expect to happen. Let me explain... 

<br>

EXPECTATIONS AND ICE CREAM

If you'd want to get a grasp on how happiness works, it makes sense to think about it this way: 

Happiness = Reality - Expectations 

Weird, huh? But let me give you an example: 

Imagine it's a hot summer day, and you're craving ice cream.  

In scenario A, you're expecting a huge, triple-scoop sundae with all the toppings. But when you get to the ice cream shop, they only have one flavor left, and you end up with a single scoop. Bit of a letdown, right?

Now, scenario B: You're not expecting any ice cream at all. You're just out for a walk, and suddenly, someone offers you a single scoop of ice cream. Surprise! You'd probably be pretty thrilled, even though it's the exact same scoop as in scenario A.

See what happened there? Same reality (one scoop of ice cream), but very different levels of happiness because of the expectations. That's the power of this little formula.  Can you think of a situation where you didn't get what you expected? Or a moment where you got way more than you expected? How did you feel?  

<br>

CONNECTING THE DOTS

Now let's connect some dots and explore how the prior two letters on what you want and hedonic adaptation play into this:

We decide what we want, and we expect that getting it will make us happy, right?

Then we get it (yay!), and we feel happy... for a while. But then that tricky hedonic treadmill kicks in, and we're back where we started.

It's like being on a happiness treadmill, always running after the next thing that we think will make us happy. Sounds exhausting? Well, it doesn't have to be.  

<br>

STEPPING OFF THE TREADMILL

You can step off the happiness treadmill.

Here are a few tricks:

1. Choose your wants wisely. Remember how we talked about peeling back the layers of what you want by asking "why"? Keep doing that. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to find something that brings lasting happiness.

2. Manage your expectations. If you expect every day to be AMAZING, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you expect each day to have both good and not-so-good moments, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised more often.  

<br>

THE TIME-FLYING HAPPINESS METER

Here is another trick that can help you to be happier: Have you ever noticed how time seems to fly when you're really happy? 

When you're hanging out with your friends and suddenly realize hours have passed, or when you're working on something you love and forget to eat lunch? This "losing track of time" feeling is happiness gold and a great way to meter your happiness. Take note when that happens and see how you can have more of it in your life.  

<br>

BUT WAIT... IS HAPPINESS ALWAYS THE GOAL?

Now, you might be thinking, "Dad, should we always try to be happy? Is that the most important thing in life?" That's a great question! 

While happiness is wonderful, it's not the only important feeling. Sometimes, other emotions like sadness, anger, or frustration can be valuable too. They can help us understand ourselves better, motivate us to make changes, or help us empathize with others.

Also, always chasing happiness might make us avoid challenges that could help us grow. Imagine if you never tried anything difficult because it might not make you happy right away. You might miss out on some amazing experiences and achievements!

<br>

THE FULL PICTURE OF HAPPINESS

Now, here's something important to remember: while understanding happiness is valuable, it's not the only thing that matters in life. A full life includes a range of emotions and experiences, both happy and not-so-happy ones. 

It's not about running the fastest on the treadmill or covering the most distance. It's about finding meaning in your journey, whatever pace you're at. When you feel that treadmill speeding up too much, remind yourself that constantly chasing "more" isn't the answer.

Remember, it's not the pursuit of happiness, it's the happiness of the pursuit. Try to catch yourself and be in the moment - that's where the real treasures are!
 
Love, Dad

<br>
 
P.S. You know what makes my happiness meter go off the charts? You reading this line, because it means that you didn't stop reading these letters yet. I hope you keep going!

LETTER 05

THE POWER OF CHANGE: WHY LIFE ISN'T ALWAYS SMOOTH SAILING (AND WHY THAT'S OK!)

<br>

Hi kids,

We've talked about the hedonic treadmill and happiness before. Today, we're talking about something that ties it all together: change. Yep, that's right – we're going to chat about why things never stay the same and why that's important for how you feel.

THE CHANGE DETECTOR IN YOUR BRAIN

Picture this: You're sitting in your room, and there's a fan buzzing away. At first, you notice it, right? But after a while, it's like your brain says, "Nothing important here," and you stop hearing it. But the second someone turns it off – you notice it again.

That's your brain's change detector at work. It's like a smart security system that's always on the lookout for anything different. Why? Because way back when our ancestors were dodging saber-toothed tigers, noticing changes could mean the difference between being lunch and, well, not being lunch.

CHANGE AND YOUR MOOD

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Change plays a huge role in how we feel. When things change for the better, we tend to feel happy. When they change for the worse, we might feel sad. And when nothing changes? We're just… neutral.

Remember how we talked about expectations in our happiness letter? Well, they're part of this too. When a change beats what we expected, we feel extra happy. When it falls short, we might feel disappointed. It's like your mood is on a seesaw that goes up and down with every change, influenced by what you thought would happen. Not always fun, but definitely important to understand!

WHY WE CAN'T BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME

"But Dad," you might be thinking, "if good changes make us happy, why can't we just have good changes all the time?"

Great question! Our brains are designed to notice differences, not constants. If everything was great all the time, our brains would get used to it and stop noticing the greatness. It's like having your favorite meal every day – eventually, it just becomes... food.

USING CHANGE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

Now that you know about your brain's change detector, you can use this knowledge. Here are some ideas:

1. Embrace change: Seek out new experiences, even small ones. Your brain thrives on novelty, and while it might feel uncomfortable at first, it's how we learn and grow.

2. Notice the little things: Pay attention to small positive changes in your day. It's like giving your brain little presents.

3. Be a change-maker: Don't just wait for good changes. Try to create positive changes for yourself and others.

4. Be patient with tough changes: When changes feel difficult, remember that your brain will adapt. It might take time, but you'll get there.

5. Think about good changes: Take a moment each day to remember positive changes, no matter how small. It helps train your brain to notice the good stuff.

THE BIG PICTURE

Here's the cool part: understanding change helps you navigate life better. It's not about always being happy (sorry, that's not how we're wired). It's about understanding why you feel the way you do and knowing that it's all part of being human.

So next time you're feeling great or not so great, remember: change is behind it all. And with a little practice, you have the power to handle those changes like a pro.

Love, Dad

P.S. Speaking of change, I changed my mind about the pet dragon. But maybe we can start with a goldfish and work our way up? 😉

LETTER 06

WHAT'S NORMAL ANYWAY? (AND WHY IT'S WAY MORE INTERESTING THAN YOU THINK)

<br>

Hi kids,

I can almost hear you groaning, "Oh great, Dad. First, you almost put us to sleep with your first few letters, and now you're writing about what's normal? Seriously…?"

Well, hold onto your pillows, because we're about to find out why "normal" is actually pretty weird and super interesting!

NORMAL ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS

Here's a mind-bender for you: What's normal for you might be totally bizarre for someone else.

Think about it this way: You wake up, have cereal for breakfast, go to school, play tennis after homework, and have dinner with the family. That's a normal day for you. But for a kid your age living in a small village in India, their normal day might involve helping with farm chores before school, eating spicy lentils for lunch, and playing cricket with friends in the evening.

Neither day is more "normal" than the other. They're just different normals!

YOUR BRAIN'S DEFINITION OF NORMAL

Remember how we talked about your brain being a change detector? Well, it uses what it considers "normal" as its starting point. Everything you've experienced in your life so far has shaped your brain's idea of what's normal.

It's like your brain has a big box labeled "NORMAL STUFF," and it tosses everything it sees and experiences into that box. Then, when something new comes along, your brain compares it to what's in the box. If it's similar, it thinks, "Eh, nothing special." But if it's really different, it goes, "Whoa, check this out!"

WHEN NORMALS COLLIDE

Now, here's where it gets really interesting. Imagine what happens when people with different "normals" meet. It's like two aliens trying to understand each other's home planets!

This clash of "normals" can lead to misunderstandings. For example, in some cultures, it's normal to slurp your soup loudly to show you're enjoying it. In others, that would be considered super rude. Neither way is right or wrong – they're just different normals.

But here's the cool part: when you understand that everyone has their own "normal," you can start asking questions and learning about others. It's like being a detective, uncovering the mysteries of different ways of life. That way you become a master of getting along with all sorts of people!

NORMAL AND HAPPINESS: AN UNEXPECTED PAIR

Your idea of "normal" also plays a role in your happiness. It's like the baseline your brain uses to judge whether things are going well or not. This ties back to our chats about the hedonic treadmill and happiness, but with a twist.

Here's a trick some wise ancient philosophers (called Stoics) used: they'd imagine losing things they cared about. Sounds weird, right? But by doing this, they'd end up feeling super grateful for their actual normal life and be better prepared for tough times. Suddenly, ordinary things seem pretty awesome!

USING YOUR "NORMAL" SUPERPOWERS

Now that you know "normal" is just something your brain invented, you can use this knowledge like a superpower. Here are some ideas:

1. Be a "normal" detective: When you meet someone new, try to uncover their "normal." Ask them about their daily life, traditions, or what they do for fun. You might discover some really cool stuff!

2. Challenge your 'normal': Step outside your comfort zone and experience different ways of living or thinking. 

3. Play the "gratitude game": Once a day, imagine how your life could be tougher by losing something that you like. Suddenly, your normal life might seem pretty great!

4. Be a "normal" translator: When you see people misunderstanding each other, you can help explain their different "normals." It's like being a superhero, but instead of stopping bad guys, you're stopping confusion!

5. Question your "normal": If there's something in your life you don't like, ask yourself, "Does this have to be my normal?" You might be surprised at what you can change!

EMBRACING THE POWER OF "NOT NORMAL"

Understanding that "normal" is different for everyone is like having x-ray vision for human behavior. It helps you understand others better, appreciate what you have, and even change things you don't like.

So next time someone says something is "weird" or "not normal," remember: normal is just what we're used to. And the amazing thing is, you can decide what you want to get used to!

Love, Your completely not normal Dad

PS: Be honest, you didn't expect normal being so interesting, did you? I hope you're fully awake again by now and able to tackle the next letter…
