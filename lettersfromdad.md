LETTER 01

Hi kids, 

Here it is. The first letter of a series of letters that I plan to write to you.

Why am I doing this: 

Over the years I couldn’t help but recognize all sorts of things that I would have loved to know growing up, but weren’t taught in school. 
At some point I started to take notes every time I understood something that I found interesting or helpful. Initially I never really considered to do anything with them.


But when you showed up everything changed. 


 As you are still young and it’s uncertain if I can share these lessons in person when the time has come, I’ve decided to write them down.
 Frankly, I don’t think that you will follow or apply most of the advice and that is ok.  Life is about making your own mistakes and learning from them. But if even only 5% of this is going to be useful to you, it is still a win. :)

I will try and keep the letters rather short so that you can read them quickly. My goal is to try to get to behind the why of things and give actionable advice, while not being boring. You might think: Good luck with that - but hey, it’s worth a try.
 I’ll write them in a somewhat organized manner, but it still should work to jump back and forth as they won’t build too much onto each other. 

A good age to start reading these might be when you enter puberty, so the age when you prefer reading from me rather than talking to me anyways (lol). 

Alright, let’s get started before I risk losing your attention due to even more dad jokes. 
Off to letter number 01.

Love you, 
Dad

LETTER 02

WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT 
(NO, REALLY!) 

<br>


Hi kids,  

Today I am going to write about “What Do You Really Want? (No, Really!)”.   Reading the title you might think: That’s easy, I want ice cream! 
But trust me, sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it is trickier to find out what you really want. No, really! ;)

Let me explain:  

<br>

THE WORLD AND YOU

Here's the thing: we're all influenced by the world around us. Your friends, family, social media, even those sneaky ads – they're all telling you what you should want. Sometimes that makes us try to be all things to all people. But are those things really what you want? 

Let's play a little game: Think about something you really want right now. Got it? Okay, now ask yourself: "Why do I want this?" Keep asking "Why?" until you can't go any further. You might be surprised where you end up!  

<br>

PEELING BACK THE LAYERS

Sometimes, what we think we want is just the wrapping paper. We need to tear it off to find the real gift inside. 
For example: You might say, "I want to be rich!" But why? "So I can buy whatever I want." Okay, but why? "So I need not to worry about money." Ah, now we're getting somewhere! 

See what happened? You started with "being rich" but ended up at “not needing to worry”. Those are the real desires hiding underneath. All it took is asking “why” a couple of times.  

<br>

BEING TRUE TO YOU

Now comes the tricky part: being honest with yourself about what you really want. It's not always easy, especially if it's different from what others expect. Even I still find this hard sometimes! 

Imagine this: Your friends are all super excited about joining the hockey team. They keep talking about how awesome it'll be if you all play together. But deep down, you'd rather join the chess club instead. 

It takes guts to say, "Actually, I think I want to try something different." But that's what being true to yourself is all about. It's about listening to that little voice inside you, even when it's saying something unexpected.   To stand out due to wanting something different can be hard sometimes. But remember to be “outstanding” can be something good as well!

Generally, there's no "right" or "wrong" when it comes to what you want. The only mistake is pretending to want something just because you think that's what you're supposed to want.  

<br>

HOW TO FIGURE IT OUT 

So, how do you uncover your true desires? Here are some tricks:

1. Write things down. It will help you to think clearly.

2. Pay attention to what excites you. What makes you lose track of time?

3. Notice your daydreams. What do you imagine when your mind wanders?

4. Think about your dreams when you were little. Sometimes our younger selves knew what we really wanted before the world told us otherwise.

5. And maybe most importantly: Try new things! You might discover desires you never knew you had.
   
<br>

WHY IT MATTERS 

Knowing what you truly want is like having a compass for your life. It helps you make decisions that align with your authentic self. And when you're living authentically? That's when life gets really good.

But here's the plot twist: What you want can change over time, and that's okay! The important thing is to keep checking in with yourself. 

Only be beware of shiny new things, they can distract you away from what you really want. When you think about switching course maybe a bit too quickly, it’s important to slow down.  Take some time to write and think. 
What do YOU want? Not what you think you should want, or what others want for you, but what lights YOU up inside? Have confidence in your gut feeling. 

It might take some soul-searching, but I promise it's worth it. After all, it's your life – shouldn't you be the one deciding what you want from it? 

Love, Dad 

<br>


P.S. If you figure out what you really want is a pet dragon, let me know. We might need to have another talk about reality vs. fantasy! ;)

LETTER 03

THE HEDONIC TREADMILL: THE NEVER-ENDING CHASE FOR MORE

<br>

 Hi kids, 

Today we're going to talk about something called the "hedonic treadmill." I know, it sounds like some fancy exercise equipment, but trust me, it's way more interesting (and way less sweaty)! ;)

<br>

WHAT'S THIS TREADMILL ALL ABOUT?

Imagine you just got the new shoes you've been begging for. You're over the moon excited, right? But after a few weeks, it doesn't feel as thrilling anymore. You're back to your usual level of happiness. That, my dear kiddos, is the hedonic treadmill in action.

The hedonic treadmill is this tricky thing our brains do. When something good happens, we get a boost of happiness. But over time, we get used to it, and that happiness fades back to our normal level. Even worse, getting the same thing again won't bring as much joy as the first time.  

<br>

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?

Here's the deal: understanding the hedonic treadmill can save you a lot of disappointment (and maybe some allowance money too). It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking, "If I just get X, then I'll be happy forever!" But life doesn't work that way.
Instead, we often find ourselves wanting more, better, bigger. The new Lego figure? Cool for a while, but then you start eyeing the ice cream truck. After that it has to be a whole farm. Bigger, better, more!   

This constant chase can leave you feeling unsatisfied and maybe even a bit unhappy. If you're always focused on the next big thing, you might miss out on enjoying what you have right now.

<br>

BREAKING FREE FROM THE TREADMILL

So, are we doomed to always chase the next big thing? No! 
Here are some tricks to outsmart that tricky treadmill: 

1. Appreciate what you have: Take a moment each day to think about something you're grateful for. It could be as simple as your favorite snack or a fun day with friends.

2. Focus on experiences, not things: Material stuff gets old fast, but memories last. That family camping trip might bring you more lasting joy than a new gadget.

3. Set goals: Working towards something gives you a sense of purpose and achievement. It's not just about the end result, but the journey too.

4. Help others: Doing something kind for someone else can give you a happiness boost that lasts longer than buying something for yourself.
   
<br>

THE PLOT TWIST

Here's the funny thing about the hedonic treadmill: it works both ways. Just like we get used to good things, we also adapt to not-so-great situations. Remember that time you thought you'd never get over losing your favorite toy? But you did, right?

This is actually pretty cool because it means that even when life throws you a curveball, you have an amazing ability to bounce back. Your baseline happiness is more resilient than you might think!  

<br>

WHY IT MATTERS
 
Understanding the hedonic treadmill isn't about giving up on wanting things or having goals. It's about being smarter about what really makes you happy in the long run. It's about finding joy in the everyday stuff, not just the big exciting moments. 

So next time you're tempted to think, "I'll be happy when..." remember the hedonic treadmill. True happiness isn't about running faster to get the next thing. It's about learning to enjoy the journey, wherever you are on the path. 

Love, Dad

<br>

  PS: Ok, ok… I’ll confess, the rule of the Hedonic Treadmill doesn’t apply to all things. There is one thing that for me still feels as good as the first time and that is: a hug from you. True story! ;)

LETTER 04

HAPPINESS

<br>

Hi kids, 

Today it’s about a big topic: Happiness.

You might think "How is this big? Happiness is super simple: I get what I want, and voila! I'm happy, right? 

Well, kind of. There's more to it than just getting what you want. Happiness also involves what you expect to happen. Let me explain... 

<br>

EXPECTATIONS AND ICE CREAM

If you'd want to get a grasp on how happiness works, it makes sense to think about it this way: 

Happiness = Reality - Expectations 

Weird, huh? But let me give you an example: 

Imagine it's a hot summer day, and you're craving ice cream.  
In scenario A, you're expecting a huge, triple-scoop sundae with all the toppings. But when you get to the ice cream shop, they only have one flavor left, and you end up with a single scoop. Bit of a letdown, right?

Now, scenario B: You're not expecting any ice cream at all. You're just out for a walk, and suddenly, someone offers you a single scoop of ice cream. Surprise! You'd probably be pretty thrilled, even though it's the exact same scoop as in scenario A.

See what happened there? Same reality (one scoop of ice cream), but very different levels of happiness because of the expectations. That's the power of this little formula.  Can you think of a situation where you didn’t get what you expected? Or a moment where you got way more than you expected? How did you feel?  

<br>

CONNECTING THE DOTS

Now let's connect some dots and explore how the prior two letters on what you want and hedonic adaptation play into this:
We decide what we want, and we expect that getting it will make us happy, right?

Then we get it (yay!), and we feel happy... for a while. But then that tricky hedonic treadmill kicks in, and we're back where we started.

It's like being on a happiness treadmill, always running after the next thing that we think will make us happy. Sounds exhausting? Well, it doesn't have to be.  

<br>

STEPPING OFF THE TREADMILL

You can step off the happiness treadmill.

Here are a few tricks:

1. Choose your wants wisely. Remember how we talked about peeling back the layers of what you want by asking "why"? Keep doing that. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to find something that brings lasting happiness.

2. Manage your expectations. If you expect every day to be AMAZING, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you expect each day to have both good and not-so-good moments, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised more often.  

<br>

THE TIME-FLYING HAPPINESS METER

Here is another trick that can help you to be happier: Have you ever noticed how time seems to fly when you're really happy? 
When you're hanging out with your friends and suddenly realize hours have passed, or when you're working on something you love and forget to eat lunch? This "losing track of time" feeling is happiness gold and a great way to meter your happiness. Take note when that happens and see how you can have more of it in your life.  

<br>

THE FULL PICTURE OF HAPPINESS

Now, here's something important to remember: while chasing happiness can be great, it's not the end all be all. It's not the persuit of happiness, it's the happiness of the persuit.

It's not about running the fastest on the treadmill or covering the most distance. It's about enjoying your workout, whatever pace you're at. When you feel that treadmill speeding up too much, remind yourself that constantly chasing "more" isn't the answer. Eating too much ice cream and your belly hurts, right?

Instead, try to catch yourself and be in the moment - that's where the real treasures are!
 
Love, Dad

<br>
 
P.S. You know what makes my happiness meter go off the charts? You reading this line, because it means that you didn't stop reading these letters yet. I hope you keep going!
